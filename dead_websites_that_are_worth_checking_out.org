These website are not on the Web and only exist on archives.

- [[https://archive.fo/lmBNz][Taking Notes Now]]: Was ran by the philosopher Manfred Kuehn. This is where I first heard of the /Zettelkasten/ idea back in 2015?

- [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200114110035/users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary][Wagner Library]]: This was by far the best website I have read on Richard Wagner. I really liked it since it doesn't sugercoat or be apologia, it tells exactly what he did, what he wrote and what people thought about him. 

  - Simple fast static website that is easily navigable. 99% of websites on Richard Wagner are some of the most bloated wordpress sites I have ever seen. It also included content in multiple formats, RSS for updates.

  - Doesn't whitewash him. Includes his problematic and disgusting writings. I have seen very few website on Wagner include them. I think that websites should strive for a honest look, not be PR.

  - If you make a website on a person please model it after this website.

  - [[https://web.archive.org/web/20050311154727/http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/other/index.htm][Hard to find commentary on Wagner]]. Very interestings dissertations on Wagner that you don't see linked anywhere anymore.

- [[https://github.com/schemedoc/bibliography][readscheme]]: Bibliography of Scheme research

- [[https://nothing2seeherepleasedisperse.blogspot.com/][SFL lovers mailing list blogpost reading]]
