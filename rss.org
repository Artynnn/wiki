* what is RSS? and how do I use it?

RSS is a way to follow updates to websites, however there are many different ways to see it.

- user agent to the web
- some see it as a notification system
- personal newspaper (with their own personal design)
- multi-platform social media client
- a personal live bookmarking system, and a more user-centric "history" and "search".
- like "email", a personal to-do list and they must have a "zero inbox".

This is done via a RSS 2.0 or ATOM XML document that your feed reader downloads and parses.
  
* history of RSS

RSS had a complicated history. From Netscape RDF site summary, to aggregator (Winer's RSS 9.x) to O'Reilly expansive RSS 1 and Winer's final revision RSS 2. And a simpler project of ATOM.

RSS proper came about in the early 2000s. It's first introduction was in the 1999. Note the RSS protocol has a lot of technical problems ([[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/23/][see this]]), and the RSS project was lead by, [[http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/rss-has-been-damaged-by-in-fighting-among-those-who-advocate-for-it][what many saw as a despotic dictator]]. These two problems lead to the creation of ATOM protocol, which most people who build feed readers prefer you to use. [fn:1]

RSS never re-gained it's mid 2000s centrality, numerous [[https://mattmower.com/2021/08/02/what-we-lost/][websites build on top of it]] to create social applications like [[https://www.ripgooglereader.com/][Google Reader]]. And many mega-corporations saw fit to abandon it for their own walled gardens like Google shutting down Google Reader for Google+ and their other products, [[https://web.archive.org/web/20110602013236/http://www.staynalive.com/2011/05/twitter-and-facebook-both-quietly-kill.html?q=1][Twitter and Facebook removing the ability to follow by RSS]].

* what features should your feeder reader have?

There are so many options but I think having these qualites are ideal for a feed reader.

- be able to change the styling
- be able to categorize (tags, folders, categories etc)
- searchable (full text, title, tag, date etc)
- open in external program (browser, media player, PDF reader)
- extendable and programmable
- can change the keybindings
- kill or score file (be able to remove things based title, content etc, preferable programmable)
- less important:
  + different types of views
  + star items (if you can have tags this is easy)
  + be able to annotate?
  + can view offline

I personal recommend the following clients:

- liferea (GUI)
- quiteRSS (GUI)
- elfeed (Emacs)
- newsboat (TUI)

* what you can access

  I think it is imporant to write down all the possible things you can follow. People don't know how versatile it really is.

  - google custom search (need more work on understanding how)
  - pubmed search
  - academic journals
  - reddit
  - podcasts
  - github / gitlab commits
  - youtube
  - substack
  - most blogs
  - twitter (via nitter)
  - academic journals
  - via [[https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/tree/master/bridges][bridges]]
    - discord
    - duckduckgo
    - instagram
    - [[https://github.com/remko/atomail][email]]
    - [[https://createfeed.fivefilters.org/][anything]] (with css selectors for scraping purposes)

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Though I have heard contradictory accounts. Mainly that he was bullied by the O'Reilley faction. Whatever the case, coordination was a disaster.
