This is a updating list of games I beat (note not just games I played) a long with some short thoughts on them.

I don't find numeric ratings helpful so I don't do them. And I am not listing every game I ever beat, just recent ones.

* 2021

Overall the year had me playing total classics. Other then Swords and Sandals, I would recommended all of these games. The one that blew me away was Pikmin.

1. *Faxanandu (NES)*: I beat this game with a guide ([[https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Faxanadu][Strategywiki guide]] was very well developed) and I think that greatly enhanced the experience. A very enjoyable action RPG.

2. *Flintstones: the Rescue of Dino and Hoppy (NES)*: Extremly enjoyable platformer, one of Taito's late release NES game. I find the game extremly brutal in the beginning but it gets easier once you get used to it. I like how varied the levels are in this game. Definitely one of my favorite NES games.

3. *Flintstones: The Surprise at Dinosuar Peak (SNES)*: Extremly late NES game that is a sequal to the former game. Really good and a well-deserved sequel. It uses the same game engine but adds new mechanics like character switching (you can play as Barney now and he has a different attack).

4. *Spore (PC)*: I remember really being excited to play this game when it came out but never got to. I beat it in less then a week. No stage took more then 2 hours (and 2 hours is really pushing it). I beat this game with a guide and once you know the tricks (which can be summarized in a sentence) this game is a breeze. I was personally shocked how short this game was, 

   I still like the game, but I am glad I didn't buy it when it came out. It seems like a really good game for challenges.

5. *Link to the Past (NES)*

6. *Castle of Illusion (Genesis/Mega Drive)*

7. *Pikmin (GC)*

8. *Swords and Sandals 1, 2 and 3 (Web, Flash)*

9. *Kirby and the crystal shards (N64)*

10. *Mario 64 (N64)*: Got all 120 Stars.

11. *Koroinpa Marbia Mania (Wii)*: Game that used motion control well.

* 2022

1. *EVO: Search for Eden (SNES)*: I have heard this game mentioned in regards to Spore, some see it as a spiritual pioneer. And I see the Spore similarities right away. The game is very weird and unlike most SNES games I have played.

   It is fun but there are flaws. I really wish this game a sequel and became a staple Enix franchise.
   
2. *Mario Kart Doube Dash (GC)*: If you win every Cup in Mario kart on all difficulty levels and unlock everything, I consider that completion.
